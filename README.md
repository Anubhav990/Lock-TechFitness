# Supabase Client Configuration

The 'supabaseClient.js' file is responsible for initializing and configuring the Supabase client used in the application. This file sets up the connection to Supabase using variables obtained from the Supabase dashboard.

Configuration

- Development Environment: Supabase environment variables are stored in a .env file at the root of the project. This file includes sensitive information such as the Supabase URL and API key, necessary for connecting to Supabase.
- Production Environment: For deployment, environment variables are configured through Viteâ€™s environment variable system. These variables are securely injected into the build process and used to connect to Supabase without exposing sensitive information in the codebase.

Environment Variables

- VITE_SUPABASE_URL: The URL of your Supabase instance.
- VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: The public API key used to access your Supabase instance.
